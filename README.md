# Pi-Dashboard
A Python GUI for a Rasperry Pi-powered car computer.

It is designed to look modern and aesthetically pleasing, as well as work well with a touch display. The current look is being created with an 80's retro futurism look, to fit with the stylings of a Pontiac Fiero.

The end project has a goal of incorperating GPS navigation software, FM radio, the ability to play media from storage on the device or connected devices, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, OBD1 diagnostics, and maybe more.

Big thanks to Pygame and Mutagen!
