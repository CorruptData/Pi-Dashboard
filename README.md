# Pi-Dashboard
A java GUI for a Rasperry Pi-powered car computer.

It is designed to look modern and aesthetically pleasing, as well as work well with a touch disply. The current look was created with a Buick theme, but this is easily modifiable to work with any theme.

The end project has a goal of incorperating GPS navigation software, FM radio, the ability to play media from storage on the device or connected devices, WiFi connectivity, and maybe more.
